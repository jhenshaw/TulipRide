<div><a href="javascript:showHide('div_q21', 'div_p21');" class="question" id="div_p21">[+] Where do I get the cool Tulip Ride clothing?              				                                </a></div><div id="div_q21" class="answer" style="display: none;">We're excited to offer a variety of Tulip Ride logo'd t-shirts, sweatshirts, and more.

<div><a href="javascript:showHide('div_q04', 'div_p04');" class="question" id="div_p04">[+] If I register and later decide that I can't make the ride, can I get a refund?            				</a></div><div id="div_q04" class="answer" style="display: none;">In short, no. Registrations are <strong>donations</strong> to Seattle Humane, and go straight to work saving the lives of animals in need. We can't ask the animals to return food and medication, or Seattle Humane to undo the care that they provide. Please register because you want to support this important cause and are comfortable making a <strong>donation</strong> in the form of your registration. The only exception to the no-refunds policy applies to VIP Road Captains: if they cannot join the ride, they can defer their attendance to the following year (only a year). They don't get a refund, but can use their registration a year later instead.<br><br>Please <a href="mailto:info@tulipride.org">e-mail us</a> before registering if you have questions about this no-refund policy.</div>
<div><a href="javascript:showHide('div_q05', 'div_p05');" class="question" id="div_p05">[+] If it's raining, will the ride be canceled?                   											</a></div><div id="div_q05" class="answer" style="display: none;">We ride in rain or shine! The only exception is if weather is forecast that would make the ride unsafe (ice or snow), we'll cancel it to put safety first.</div>
<div><a href="javascript:showHide('div_q06', 'div_p06');" class="question" id="div_p06">[+] Can I follow the ride in a car, or drive my car to meet up with you?                    				</a></div><div id="div_q06" class="answer" style="display: none;">No. While you can join as a breakfast-only attendee in Redmond, the ride itself is for motorcycles only and features reserved motorcycle-only parking in private areas.</div>

It helps if you register in advance at <a href="/register/">our online registration page.</a></div>

We want to help those animals get adopted by focusing attention on them. They'll be available for photo ops with the celebs, petting sessions, and more. Additionally, the motorcycles can be quite loud and may spook otherwise docile pets. As cute as your cats, birds, dogs, ferrets, iguanas, and other pets might be, please help animals in need get adopted on Tulip Ride weekend by maintaining a strict no-personal-pets policy. Thank you.</div>

<div><a href="javascript:showHide('div_q17', 'div_p17');" class="question" id="div_p17">[+] Can I pass out flyers for my own cause at the Tulip Ride?                   						   	</a></div><div id="div_q17" class="answer" style="display: none;">It's in poor taste to &quot;hijack&quot; another charity event. We ask that you join the Tulip Ride to help us support Seattle Humane, and start up your own events for causes that you're passionate about.</div>
<div><a href="javascript:showHide('div_q18', 'div_p18');" class="question" id="div_p18">[+] I signed up just to see one of the celebrities that is planning to attend. Are appearances guaranteed?	</a></div><div id="div_q18" class="answer" style="display: none;">Our celebrity riders join the Tulip Ride each year out of their shared love for giving back to our community, and their love for riding. While they make every effort to attend, sometimes scheduling conflicts get in the way. Filming schedules are a priority and it is possible that our celeb riders may have to miss a ride one year, often with little notice. We will <a href="http://twitter.com/tulipride">tweet</a> and update our site as soon as we learn of changed plans. We do not refund registrations in these cases, because registrations are donations to charities. Please register for the ride in the spirit of giving, and consider celebrity appearances as added bonuses. </div>
