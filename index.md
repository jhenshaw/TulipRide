The Tulip Ride brings motorcyclists together to benefit the Seattle Humane on their mission to save lives and complete families. We kick off the Pacific Northest motorcycle riding season with a fundraiser ride from Redmond to the Skagit Valley tulip festival. 

### With Washington still in Phase 2 of opening, the Tulip Ride will not happen in April. We'll announce the date for Tulip Ride 2021 as soon as conditions are safe for large-group gatherings, including Phase 4 support for outdoor gatherings of over 50 people.

Safety is our top priority for everyone who participates in the Tulip Ride. 

Since we do not yet have a clear idea of when it'll be safe to schedule Tulip Ride 2021, **we're delaying picking a date until official guidance - based upon data - is available.**

In the meantime, thank you for doing your part to help our communities bounce back by **getting vaccinated as soon as possible, wearing a mask in public places, washing hands frequently, and observerving social distancing guidelines.**

Stay safe, check back often, and feel free <a href="mailto:info@tulipride.org">contact us</a> anytime!
